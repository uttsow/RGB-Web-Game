# RGB-Web-Game
Inspired by a project from Colt Steele's Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp". This is written strictly in vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. 

The game has 3 modes: Easy, Hard, and Extreme.
You get 3 lives and after that you will need to press "Play Again?" to restart the game.

Just clone/download the repo and open index.html to begin playing!

This is my frist attempt at web development and coding in Javascript.
